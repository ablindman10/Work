# Work
Small programs I have written 

This is a showcase of my work.
Above are 3 programs that I am proud of! I know now some of my mistakes in writing them and I have learned alot since writing these
Now I know new ways I can improve upon the code and condense it.

One of my programs Converts Hexadecimal to Base64 using the GMP library, allowing for very large Hexadecimals to be converted.
Another program uses SHA-1 to encrypt strings smaller than 55 characters.
The last program uses Leibniz Formula and expands to the n'th term to calculate PI.
